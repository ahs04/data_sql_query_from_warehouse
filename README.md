Second Part of Data Warehouse Project involving Analysis and Reporting
https://github.com/ahs04/dataWarehouse-project

## Background
After creating a datawarehouse in a SQL server, I was able to conduct analysis and reporting for a fictional dataset involving customers, transactions, and products of items. The schema is based on a STAR schema with one central fact table and multiple dimesntion tables connecting to it.

From there, I did two types of analysis.
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Advanced Analysis

### EDA
- Basic Queries
- Database and Table Exploration
- Simple Aggregations and Subqueries
- Dimension and Measure Analysis
- Ranks

### Advanced Analysis
- Window Functions
- CTEs
- Views
- Subqueries
- Report from View
